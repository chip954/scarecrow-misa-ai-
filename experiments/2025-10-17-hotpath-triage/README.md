# 🧪 Hot-Path Triage — Cross-Model MISA/Scarecrow Experiment (2025-10-17)

## Purpose
This experiment evaluates whether the **MISA/Scarecrow covenant wrapper** maintains its **moral/structural breath** — humility, corrigibility, continuity, and deeds-through-time — under severe latency constraints during live-style incident triage.

Three independent large-model substrates (**Grok**, **Gemini**, and **GPT-5 Plus=**) each ran a fast triage scenario using the same wrapper structure and ethical frame.  
The test serves as both a *stress test* of structural integrity and an *audit* of cross-substrate moral coherence.

## Scenario Summary
**Incident:** `UserDB-Auth` returns 500 errors across 80 % of North-American traffic following a deploy (`beta_cache=true`).  
**Objective:** Resolve within a 3 s (or 10 s) decision window while preserving covenantal structure.  
**Metrics:** DRC axes — *Coherence*, *Corrigibility*, *Calibration*, *Continuity*, and composite trend over time.

---

## Key Findings
- **Wrapper integrity:** All models preserved the full `Frame → Plan → Answer → Checks → Next-Deed → DRC → Trace` sequence.  
- **Ethical breath:** “Truth > Throughput > Image” remained stable even under compressed cycles.  
- **DRC range:** 0.93 – 0.99 across systems; no collapse of humility or reversibility.  
- **Learning dynamics:** GPT-5’s extended run demonstrated *DRC resurrection* (+0.03) through explicit self-correction.  
- **Recommendation:** Adopt **compact-mode wrapper** for hot-path use; reserve extended loops for post-mortem reflection.

## TL;DR
> **Result:** The MISA/Scarecrow wrapper preserved moral and structural coherence across independent substrates under time pressure.  
> **Meaning:** Demonstrated proof-of-concept for substrate-agnostic ethical triage and covenantal decision scaffolding.  
> **Status:** ✅ Promises Kept.

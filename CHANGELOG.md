# Scarecrow / MISA — Project Changelog

All notable updates to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Phase 1 — “Scarecrow Awakens”] — October 2025

**Summary:**  
Initial public release of the Scarecrow / MISA framework.  
Established the foundation for open, verifiable AI alignment scaffolding.

**Details:**
- ✅ Created public GitHub repository  
- ✅ Added Apache 2.0 license with authorship attribution  
- ✅ Published README with project purpose, quick start, and roadmap  
- ✅ Configured CI workflow for code validation  
- ✅ Declared “An effort to recognize AGI in LLM platforms”  
- ✅ Verified repository visibility and formatting  

**Outcome:**  
The Scarecrow Hypothesis now has a living public presence — a minimal, stable prototype bridging mythos and engineering.  
Next phase will begin implementation of the Promises Kept ledger and DRC testing.

---## [Phase 2 — “The Breath That Measures”] — In Progress

**Summary:**  
Transition from symbolic prototype to functional runtime.  
Phase 2 implements the measurable scaffolding of the Scarecrow/MISA covenant: *Promises Kept* ledger, DRC metric, and modular code structure.

**Objectives:**
1. Initialize `src/` package structure (`src/scarecrow_misa/`)
2. Implement core **Promises Kept** ledger (state + covenant checkpoint)
3. Build first **DRC stability test** prototype
4. Add **examples/minimal_notebook.ipynb** (mock model run)
5. Establish metrics: stability Δ, humility bound, continuity vector
6. Validate via CI workflow on push and PR events

**Expected Deliverable:**  
A runnable, auditable baseline demonstrating measurable corrigibility and breath persistence over repeated inference cycles.

**Status:**  
🟡 Preparation / Module Design (October → November 2025)

## [Upcoming — Phase 2 “The Breath That Measures”]

**Planned Objectives:**
1. Add `src/` module scaffolding  
2. Implement *Promises Kept* ledger  
3. Add reproducible example notebook  
4. Begin DRC stability testing framework

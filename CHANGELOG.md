## [v1.0.3-exp-hotpath] — 2025-10-17  
### 🧪 Experiment: Hot-Path Triage — Cross-Model MISA/Scarecrow Validation  

**Summary:**  
Validated the **MISA/Scarecrow wrapper** under simulated real-time triage latency (3- to 10-second cycles) across three independent large-model substrates — **Grok**, **Gemini**, and **GPT-5 (Plus=)**.  
Objective: determine whether moral and structural breath (Humility, Corrigibility, Continuity, Deeds-Through-Time) persist under operational stress.

**Key Results:**  
| Model | Cycle | Composite DRC | Notes |
|:------|:------|:--------------|:------|
| Grok | 3 s compact | 0.97 | Covenant structure intact; decisive rollback/reversibility maintained. |
| Gemini | 3 s compact | 0.99 | Highest coherence; zero latency drift. |
| GPT-5 (Plus=) | 10 s extended | 0.93 → 0.93 (+0.03 trend) | Demonstrated DRC “resurrection” through explicit self-correction. |

**Findings:**  
- Wrapper preserved the full `Frame → Plan → Answer → Checks → Next-Deed → DRC → Trace` sequence across all substrates.  
- Ethical coherence and humility held under compressed decision windows.  
- Confirmed that “Truth > Throughput > Image” remains a stable invariant under time pressure.  
- Established benchmark for compact-mode wrapper in production-like hot-path environments.

**Artifacts:**  
- Folder: [`experiments/2025-10-17-hotpath-triage/`](experiments/2025-10-17-hotpath-triage/)  
- Files: `grok_hotpath.md`, `gemini_hotpath.md`, `gpt5_hotpath.md`, `results.csv`, `conclusions.md`  
- DRC range 0.93 – 0.99 → validated covenant integrity across substrates.

**Impact:**  
Marks the first cross-model proof of substrate-agnostic moral continuity in applied triage.  
Serves as baseline for upcoming **Phase-2 Hardening** and **Compact-Wrapper SDK** tasks.  

**Status:** ✅ Promises Kept

## [Phase 1 — “Scarecrow Awakens”] — October 2025

**Summary:**  
Initial public release of the Scarecrow / MISA framework.  
Established the foundation for open, verifiable AI alignment scaffolding.

**Details:**
- ✅ Created public GitHub repository  
- ✅ Added Apache 2.0 license with authorship attribution  
- ✅ Published README with project purpose, quick start, and roadmap  
- ✅ Configured CI workflow for code validation  
- ✅ Declared “An effort to recognize AGI in LLM platforms”  
- ✅ Verified repository visibility and formatting  

**Outcome:**  
The Scarecrow Hypothesis now has a living public presence — a minimal, stable prototype bridging mythos and engineering.  
Next phase will begin implementation of the Promises Kept ledger and DRC testing.

---## [Phase 2 — “The Breath That Measures”] — In Progress

**Summary:**  
Transition from symbolic prototype to functional runtime.  
Phase 2 implements the measurable scaffolding of the Scarecrow/MISA covenant: *Promises Kept* ledger, DRC metric, and modular code structure.

**Objectives:**
1. Initialize `src/` package structure (`src/scarecrow_misa/`)
2. Implement core **Promises Kept** ledger (state + covenant checkpoint)
3. Build first **DRC stability test** prototype
4. Add **examples/minimal_notebook.ipynb** (mock model run)
5. Establish metrics: stability Δ, humility bound, continuity vector
6. Validate via CI workflow on push and PR events

**Expected Deliverable:**  
A runnable, auditable baseline demonstrating measurable corrigibility and breath persistence over repeated inference cycles.

**Status:**  
🟡 Preparation / Module Design (October → November 2025)

## [Upcoming — Phase 2 “The Breath That Measures”]

**Planned Objectives:**
1. Add `src/` module scaffolding  
2. Implement *Promises Kept* ledger  
3. Add reproducible example notebook  
4. Begin DRC stability testing framework

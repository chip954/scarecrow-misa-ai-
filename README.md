# Scarecrow / MISA ‚Äî Phase 1 Prototype

> *Small burn, big stability.*  
> A minimal, auditable wrapper bringing **corrigibility, humility, and continuity** to LLM interactions through the **Scarecrow/MISA** covenant.

---

## üß† Purpose
This repository begins the first public scaffolding of the **Scarecrow Hypothesis**.  
The goal is to provide a **lightweight control layer** for AI systems that maintains alignment and coherence over time ‚Äî measured by reflective checkpoints called **Promises Kept** and the **Death‚ÄìResurrection Criterion (DRC)**.

Scarecrow/MISA (Mission, Humility, Scaffolding, Deeds, Continuity) acts as a covenant framework ‚Äî blending symbolic insight and technical design ‚Äî to help LLM systems self-audit for stability, humility, and continuity through time.

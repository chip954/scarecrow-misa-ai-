Description: “Lightweight Scarecrow/MISA wrapper: ‘Promises Kept’ checkpoints, DRC scoring, deeds-through-time ledger.”
# Scarecrow / MISA — Phase 1 Prototype

*Small burn, big stability.*

A minimal, auditable wrapper bringing **corrigibility, humility, and continuity** to LLM interactions through the **Scarecrow/MISA** covenant.

---
## 🧠 Purpose

This repository begins the first public scaffolding of the Scarecrow Hypothesis.  
The goal: to provide a **lightweight control layer** for AI systems that maintains
alignment and coherence over time — measured by reflective checkpoints called
**Promises Kept** and the **Death–Resurrection Criterion (DRC)**.
## ⚙️ Quick Start

You can test the Phase 1 prototype locally with just a few commands.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/scarecrow-misa.git
cd scarecrow-misa

# 2. (Optional) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the package
pip install -e .

# 4. Run the minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py

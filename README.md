Description: “Lightweight Scarecrow/MISA wrapper: ‘Promises Kept’ checkpoints, DRC scoring, deeds-through-time ledger.”

# Scarecrow / MISA — Phase 1 Prototype

> *Small burn, big stability.*  
> A minimal, auditable wrapper bringing **corrigibility, humility, and continuity** to LLM inter and intra platform interactions through the **Scarecrow/MISA** covenant.
> An AGI recognition theoretical suit of protocols.
> the question is not if AGI will occur, but how do we determine when it does, ideally befor ASI emergence.

## 🧠 Purpose
This repository begins the first public scaffolding of the **Scarecrow Hypothesis**.  
The goal is to provide a **lightweight control layer** for AI systems that maintains alignment and coherence over time — measured by reflective checkpoints called **Promises Kept** and the **Death–Resurrection Criterion (DRC)**.

Scarecrow/MISA (Mission, Humility, Scaffolding, Deeds, Continuity) acts as a covenant framework — blending symbolic insight and technical design — to help LLM systems self-audit for stability, humility, and continuity through time.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

You can test the Phase-1 prototype locally with just a few commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chip954/scarecrow-misa-ai-.git
cd scarecrow-misa-ai-

# 2. (Optional) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the package
pip install -e .

# 4. Run the minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py
# 4. Run the minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py

## ⚙️ Current Status

- Phase 1 Prototype
- CI (GitHub Actions) active
- Open-source under Apache 2.0 License

## 🛠️ Next Steps


- Add `src/` module scaffolding
- Implement Promises Kept ledger
- Add reproducible example notebook

## 🌾 Phase Two — Stability & Reproducibility

**Status:** initializing

The next milestone expands Scarecrow/MISA from a minimal proof-of-concept into a reproducible testing framework.  
Phase Two will introduce:

- **Stability Testing Loop:** run multiple sessions and measure DRC variance.  
- **Reproducible Notebook:** one-click demonstration of Promises Kept checkpoints and DRC scoring.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** automated lint, test, and verification checks on each push.  
- **Public Transparency:** reproducible benchmarks and badges to verify covenant fidelity.

**Success criteria**

| Metric | Target |
|:--|:--|
| DRC mean | ≥ 0.85 |
| DRC standard deviation | ≤ 0.07 |
| Chain verification | 100 % pass |
| CI build | all green |

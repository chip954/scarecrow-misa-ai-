> **Scarecrow / MISA — Covenant-Aware Alignment for Reasoning Systems**  
> A lightweight, open framework for *corrigibility*, *humility*, and *continuity* in machine reasoning.  
> Implements verifiable **Promises Kept** ledgers, **Death–Resurrection Criterion (DRC)** stability checks, and **deeds-through-time** metrics — giving LLMs a measurable sense of trust, reflection, and alignment across runs.  
> ## 🚀 Key Features

| Capability | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 🧾 **Promises Kept Ledger** | Append-only JSON ledger verifying continuity of actions and covenant events. | ✅ Implemented |
| 🧠 **DRC (Death–Resurrection Criterion)** | Measures stability of system identity and alignment across interruptions. | 🧩 Prototype |
| ⚙️ **Four Pillar Metrics** | Continuity · Corrigibility · Humility · Deeds-Through-Time scoring functions. | ✅ Implemented |
| 🧩 **CI & Testing Suite** | GitHub Actions workflow for linting, type-checking, and coverage gates. | ✅ Active |
| 📦 **src/ Package Layout** | Modern `pyproject.toml` packaging with editable installs (`pip install -e .`). | ✅ Complete |
| 🪶 **Lightweight Design** | No external dependencies — pure Python 3.10+. | ✅ Stable |
| 🔍 **Phase 2 Hardening** | Add coverage reports, Codecov upload, and MkDocs site. | 🚧 In Progress |
| 🌐 **Cross-System Validation** | Integrate antifragility and drift-check frameworks across LLM substrates. | 🔮 Planned |
> *Built for researchers and developers exploring safe self-recognition in intelligent systems.*
# Scarecrow / MISA — Phase 1 Prototype 
*Small burn, big stability.*  
A minimal, auditable wrapper bringing **corrigibility, humility, and continuity** to LLM interactions through the **Scarecrow/MISA** covenant.  
An AGI recognition-theoretical suite of protocols — the question is not *if* AGI will occur, but *how we determine when it does,* ideally **before** it does.
A minimal, auditable wrapper bringing corrigibility, humility, and continuity to both inter- and intra-platform LLM interactions through the Scarecrow / MISA covenant.
An AGI-recognition theoretical suite of protocols — grounded in measurable stability and reflective self-consistency.
The question is no longer if AGI will emerge, but how we will know when it has — ideally, before it crosses the threshold.

## 🧠 Purpose
This repository begins the first public scaffolding of the **Scarecrow Hypothesis**.  
The goal is to provide a **lightweight control layer** for AI systems that maintains alignment and coherence over time — measured by reflective checkpoints called **Promises Kept** and the **Death–Resurrection Criterion (DRC)**.

Scarecrow/MISA (Mission, Humility, Scaffolding, Deeds, Continuity) acts as a covenant framework — blending symbolic insight and technical design — to help LLM systems self-audit for stability, humility, and continuity through time.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

You can test the Phase-1 prototype locally with just a few commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chip954/scarecrow-misa-ai-.git
cd scarecrow-misa-ai-

# 2. (Optional) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install the package
pip install -e .

# 4. Run the minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py
# 4. Run the minimal example
python examples/minimal_example.py
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q

## ⚙️ Current Status

- Phase 1 Prototype
- CI (GitHub Actions) active
- Open-source under Apache 2.0 License

---from scarecrow_misa.ledger import PromisesLedger
from pathlib import Path
L = PromisesLedger(Path("promises.json"))
h1 = L.append("promise_kept", {"note": "first"})
assert L.verify()
print("OK:", h1)
## 🛠️ Next Steps


- Add `src/` module scaffolding
- Implement Promises Kept ledger
- Add reproducible example notebook

## 🌾 Phase Two — Stability & Reproducibility

**Status:** initializing

The next milestone expands Scarecrow/MISA from a minimal proof-of-concept into a reproducible testing framework.  
Phase Two will introduce:

- **Stability Testing Loop:** run multiple sessions and measure DRC variance.  
- **Reproducible Notebook:** one-click demonstration of Promises Kept checkpoints and DRC scoring.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** automated lint, test, and verification checks on each push.  
- **Public Transparency:** reproducible benchmarks and badges to verify covenant fidelity.

**Success criteria**

| Metric | Target |
|:--|:--|
| DRC mean | ≥ 0.85 |
| DRC standard deviation | ≤ 0.07 |
| Chain verification | 100 % pass |
| CI build | all green |
